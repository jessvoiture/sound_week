        <h1>Digital Sound Diary</h1>
        <div class="intro-words">
            <p>This project is an exploration into my listening habits, an exercise inspired by the weekly postcards documented in the book <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/all">Dear Data</a> by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec.</p> 
            <p>Throughout the course of week in August, I documented any digital sound I consumed. This included sound from online videos, TV or films, podcasts, and (of course) music. Data was recorded at 15 minute intervals, so the odd Tik Tok here and there was not included. I also made note of the volume of the sound and the speaker type (earphones, built-in speakers, or speakers).</p> 
            <p>Perhaps some background might help contextualize the data. I am currently on summer vacation from university. I am learning d3.js, but am otherwise unoccupied (ie why I am watching TV on a Wednesday afternoon). Due to some hearing loss in recent years, I have become more concious about how I consume sound. Most notably, I try to avoid listening through earphones. In addition, I live alongside 4 other humans so I try to be mindful of volume when listening to something without earphones.</p>
            <p>Enough babbling, here's how to read the chart ↓</p>
